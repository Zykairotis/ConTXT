 # Development Plan: AI Context Builder Backend

This document outlines the development plan for the AI Context Builder backend, integrating `cognee` for RAG capabilities.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Setup

**Objective:** Establish a solid foundation for the project.

1.  **Virtual Environment:**
    *   Create a Python 3.11+ virtual environment.
    *   Install all dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.

2.  **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Create the directory structure as defined in `Idea.md`:
        ```
        backend/
        ├── api/
        ├── agents/
        ├── processors/
        ├── knowledge/
        ├── config/
        └── main.py
        ```

3.  **Initial FastAPI App:**
    *   Create a basic "Hello World" FastAPI application in `main.py`.
    *   Ensure the development server (`uvicorn`) runs correctly.

4.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Set up a `config.py` file to manage environment variables and application settings using Pydantic.

## Phase 2: `cognee` Integration & Data Processing

**Objective:** Integrate `cognee` and build the data ingestion pipelines.

1.  **`cognee` Setup:**
    *   Initialize and configure `cognee` to connect with our databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j).
    *   Define the data models and schemas that `cognee` will use.

2.  **Content Processors:**
    *   Develop individual processors for each data source (`URL`, `PDF`, `YouTube`, etc.) in the `backend/processors/` directory.
    *   Each processor will extract content and pass it to the `cognee` RAG pipeline for ingestion.

3.  **API Endpoints for Ingestion:**
    *   Create API endpoints in `backend/api/routes.py` to trigger the content processors.
    *   For example: `POST /process-url`, `POST /process-pdf`.

4.  **Celery for Background Tasks:**
    *   Integrate Celery to handle time-consuming tasks like video processing and large document ingestion in the background.

## Phase 3: Intelligence Layer & Core Logic

**Objective:** Implement the intelligent agents and core business logic.

1.  **Knowledge Graph Builder:**
    *   Develop the `KnowledgeGraphBuilder` in `backend/knowledge/` to manage how information is structured and stored in Neo4j.

2.  **Agent Development:**
    *   Implement the `ContextAnalyzer`, `SystemPromptGenerator`, and `RulesEngine` in the `backend/agents/` directory.
    *   These agents will query the `cognee` RAG system and the Neo4j graph to gather context.

3.  **Main API Endpoint:**
    *   Create the primary API endpoint (e.g., `POST /build-context`) that orchestrates the entire process:
        *   Takes user input/sources.
        *   Calls the appropriate processors.
        *   Triggers the intelligent agents.
        *   Returns the final generated system prompt and rules.

## Phase 4: Finalization & Polish

**Objective:** Ensure the application is robust, secure, and well-documented.

1.  **Authentication & Security:**
    *   Implement user authentication if required.
    *   Secure all API endpoints.

2.  **Error Handling & Validation:**
    *   Add comprehensive error handling and input validation throughout the application.

3.  **API Documentation:**
    *   Generate and refine the OpenAPI documentation for the API.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for all major components.
