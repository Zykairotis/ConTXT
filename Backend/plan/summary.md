# AI Context Builder Backend: Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've set up the basic structure for the AI Context Builder backend with the following components:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Created a modular directory structure following best practices
   - Set up Python package structure with proper `__init__.py` files
   - Created a `pyproject.toml` for dependency management

2. **Configuration**:
   - Created a settings module using Pydantic for type-safe configuration
   - Set up environment variable handling with `.env.example`
   - Configured Celery for background task processing

3. **API Framework**:
   - Set up FastAPI with basic routes and endpoints
   - Created Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Added basic health check endpoint

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Created a base processor class with common functionality
   - Implemented a basic URL processor as an example
   - Set up the structure for other processors

5. **AI Agents**:
   - Created a basic context builder agent
   - Set up LangGraph workflow structure
   - Defined input/output models for the agent

6. **Knowledge Management**:
   - Set up Neo4j integration for knowledge graph
   - Created basic CRUD operations for entities and relationships
   - Prepared for vector embedding storage

7. **Testing**:
   - Set up basic API tests
   - Created test directory structure
   - Prepared for more comprehensive testing

8. **Deployment**:
   - Created a Dockerfile for containerization
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Configured services for PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, and Qdrant

9. **Documentation**:
   - Created a README.md with project overview
   - Documented the project structure and features
   - Created a detailed implementation plan

## Next Steps

The next steps in the project are outlined in the implementation plan. Here's a summary of the immediate next steps:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Set up the actual database schemas and connections
   - Configure Neo4j with the appropriate node and relationship types
   - Set up Qdrant for vector embeddings

2. **Cognee Integration**:
   - Set up Cognee with the appropriate configuration
   - Create an integration layer between our application and Cognee
   - Test basic RAG functionality with sample documents

3. **Data Processors**:
   - Complete the URL processor implementation
   - Implement the PDF processor
   - Implement the video processor
   - Implement the conversation processor

4. **Knowledge Graph**:
   - Define entity types and relationship types
   - Implement chunking and embedding generation
   - Set up semantic search functionality

5. **LangGraph Agents**:
   - Complete the context builder agent implementation
   - Implement the system prompt generator
   - Implement the rules engine

6. **API & Integration**:
   - Complete all API endpoints
   - Set up Celery tasks for background processing
   - Create integration points with the frontend

## Getting Started

To start working on the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e .`
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values
6. Start the development server: `uvicorn Backend.main:app --reload`

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose:

```bash
cd Backend
docker-compose up
```

This will start all the required services (API, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Qdrant) in containers.
