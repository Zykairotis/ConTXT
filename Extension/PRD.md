# ConTXT Browser Extension: Phase-Based Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the product requirements for the ConTXT Browser Extension, organized by the development phases outlined in the project's implementation plan[1]. It specifies the features, deliverables, and success criteria for each stage of development, ensuring a focused and sequential build process.

### **Product Vision**
To create an intuitive, powerful browser extension that transforms web browsing into a structured context engineering process, seamlessly connecting web research with AI-driven development workflows[2][3].

### **Core Architecture**
The extension is built on a modular architecture featuring Core Services (API, Storage, Content Capture, Ingestion), Extension Components (Background/Content Scripts, Popup UI), and Backend Integration with the ConTXT FastAPI server[4][5].

## 2. Phased Development Requirements

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure**
*   **Goal**: To establish a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the development of the extension.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: 1 week[1].

| Requirement ID | Feature/Requirement | Description | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1-01** | **Project Scaffolding** | Create the complete directory structure for `src`, `assets`, `background`, `contentScript`, `popup`, and `services`[4]. | Git repository with defined folder structure. | All necessary directories and initial files are in place and version controlled. |
| **P1-02** | **Build System** | Configure Webpack (`webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, `webpack.prod.js`) for development and production builds. | Functional Webpack configuration files. | `npm run build` generates optimized production assets; `npm run dev` starts a development server with hot-reloading. |
| **P1-03** | **Cross-Browser Manifest** | Create a `manifest.json` file compatible with both Chrome (V3) and Firefox, defining core properties like name, version, and permissions[1]. | A single `manifest.json` file. | The extension can be loaded unpacked in both Chrome and Firefox without errors. |
| **P1-04** | **TypeScript Configuration** | Set up `tsconfig.json` to enforce strict type safety across the entire codebase[4]. | A configured `tsconfig.json` file. | The project compiles without TypeScript errors. |
| **P1-05** | **Testing Framework** | Integrate Jest for unit testing of services and components[1]. | Jest configuration and example test files. | `npm test` successfully runs the test suite. |

### **Phase 2: Core Services Implementation**
*   **Goal**: To build the foundational, non-UI logic that powers the extension's core functionality.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: 2 weeks[1].

| Requirement ID | Feature/Requirement | Description | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P2-01** | **StorageService** | Implement `storage.ts` to manage settings (API URL, user preferences) using the `browser.storage.local` API[4]. | `StorageService` module with `get`, `set`, and `remove` methods. | Settings are successfully persisted across browser sessions. |
| **P2-02** | **ApiService** | Implement `api.ts` to handle all communication with the backend FastAPI server, including POST requests for ingestion and GET requests for status checks[4]. | `ApiService` module capable of sending data to all required backend endpoints. | Successful API calls can be made to the backend, and responses are handled correctly. |
| **P2-03** | **ContentCaptureService** | Implement the shell for `contentCapture.ts` to house the logic for capturing various content types (URL, text, etc.)[4]. | `ContentCaptureService` module with placeholder methods for each content type. | The service structure is in place and ready for content handler implementation in Phase 4. |
| **P2-04** | **IngestionService** | Implement `ingestion.ts` to act as a coordinator between UI components, the `ContentCaptureService`, and the `ApiService`[4]. | `IngestionService` module to orchestrate the flow from capture to backend submission. | The service correctly routes capture requests to the appropriate services. |
| **P2-05** | **Unit Testing** | Write comprehensive unit tests for all public methods within the four core services[1]. | A suite of unit tests with high coverage. | Core services have at least 80% unit test coverage. |

### **Phase 3: Extension Components Implementation**
*   **Goal**: To build the user-facing and browser-level components that enable interaction.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: 2 weeks[1].

| Requirement ID | Feature/Requirement | Description | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P3-01** | **Background Script** | Implement `background/index.ts` to handle the creation of context menus and listen for messages from other parts of the extension[4]. | A functional background script. | Right-clicking on a webpage displays a "Send to ConTXT" context menu. |
| **P3-02** | **Content Script** | Implement `contentScript/index.ts` to interact with the DOM of a web page, enabling text selection and HTML element capture[4]. | A functional content script. | The extension can programmatically extract selected text from a live webpage. |
| **P3-03** | **Popup UI** | Develop the main user interface using React (`popup/index.tsx`) with buttons for each capture type[2][6]. | A functional React-based popup. | Clicking the extension icon opens a popup with interactive UI elements. |
| **P3-04** | **Component Communication** | Establish messaging between the Popup, Content Script, and Background Script using `browser.runtime.sendMessage` and `browser.tabs.sendMessage`[4]. | Integrated extension components. | Clicking a button in the popup successfully triggers an action in the background script. |

### **Phase 4: Content Type Handlers**
*   **Goal**: To implement the specific logic for capturing all supported content types.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: 3 weeks[1].
