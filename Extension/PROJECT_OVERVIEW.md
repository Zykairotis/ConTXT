# ConTXT Browser Extension Project Overview

## Purpose

The ConTXT Browser Extension serves as a bridge between web-based research and the AI Context Engineering Agent. It enables users to seamlessly capture and send web content directly to the ConTXT backend for processing and integration into the project's knowledge base, enhancing the AI's contextual understanding.

## Key Features

### Content Capture Capabilities

- **URL Processing**: Capture and send the current URL for content extraction
- **Text Selection**: Extract and process selected text from web pages
- **Screenshot Capture**: Take full or partial webpage screenshots
- **HTML Extraction**: Capture specific HTML elements or entire page structure
- **Chat Conversation Capture**: Extract conversations from AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok
- **File Processing**: Upload and process various file types:
  - PDFs
  - Images (PNG, JPG)
  - Structured Data (JSON, CSV, XML)
  - Documents (HTML, Markdown)

### User Interface

- **Popup Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI for selecting capture options
- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click options for capturing content
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Easy file uploading via drag-and-drop
- **Settings Management**: Configure API endpoints and capture preferences
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of ingestion jobs

### Backend Integration

- **API Communication**: Seamless connection to ConTXT backend APIs
- **Job Tracking**: Monitor the status of ingestion processes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Capture relevant metadata for better context

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **User Interface Layer**: React-based popup and context menu
- **Extension Components**: Background script, content script, and service workers
- **Services Layer**: API, storage, and content capture services
- **Backend Integration**: Connection to FastAPI endpoints

### Technology Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **UI Framework**: React
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, npm
- **Browser APIs**: Web Extensions API
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Backend Communication**: Fetch API

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Version 88+
- **Firefox**: Version 78+
- **Edge**: Version 88+ (Chromium-based)

### Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions model
- **Data Processing**: Local processing before transmission
- **User Control**: Full user control over what is captured and sent
- **Data Storage**: Secure local storage for settings

## Development Approach

The development follows a phased approach:

1. **Project Setup**: Infrastructure and tooling
2. **Core Services**: Fundamental service implementations
3. **Extension Components**: UI and extension-specific components
4. **Content Handlers**: Specialized handlers for each content type
5. **Backend Integration**: API connections and authentication
6. **UX Enhancements**: Improved user experience features
7. **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive testing across browsers
8. **Packaging & Deployment**: Store-ready packages
9. **Documentation & Support**: User and developer documentation

## Project Status

The project is currently in the initial development phase, with the core architecture and services implemented. The next steps focus on completing the content type handlers and enhancing the user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Content Selection**: More precise content selection tools
- **Offline Processing**: Process content offline before sending
- **Batch Processing**: Send multiple items in a single operation
- **Custom Processors**: User-defined content processors
- **Integration with More Platforms**: Support for additional chat and content platforms
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and performance metrics

## Conclusion

The ConTXT Browser Extension is a critical component of the AI Context Engineering Agent ecosystem, providing a seamless way to capture and integrate web content into the knowledge base. Its modular design ensures maintainability and extensibility, while its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to all users.
