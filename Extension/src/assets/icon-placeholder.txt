This is a placeholder for the extension icons.

In a real extension, you would need to create the following icon files:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are used for the browser toolbar,
extension management page, and other places in the browser UI.

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online icon generators.
Make sure they are in PNG format with transparency for best results.
