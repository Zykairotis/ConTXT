# Extension Assets

This directory contains the assets used by the ConTXT browser extension.

## Required Assets

The following icon files are required for the extension:

- `icon-16.png` (16x16px) - Used for favicon and small UI elements
- `icon-48.png` (48x48px) - Used for extension toolbar icon
- `icon-128.png` (128x128px) - Used for extension stores and installation

## Guidelines

- Icons should be in PNG format with transparency
- Use the ConTXT branding colors and style
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Test icons against both light and dark browser themes

## Placeholder Assets

During development, placeholder icons are used. These should be replaced with final assets before release.

## Additional Assets

Any additional assets (images, fonts, etc.) used by the extension should also be placed in this directory.
